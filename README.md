==============================================
Python tutorials for Climate Science, developed for the Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program (PURM).<br> 
Authored by Xueke Li, Department of Earth and Environmental Science, University of Pennsylvania (Personal website: )

Getting Started
-------------------
These tutorials are designed to run in a Python 3 environment using Jupyter Notebooks.

1. Install Anaconda (recommended)

   * Download and install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download), which comes preloaded with Python and Jupyter Notebook.

2. Create a New Environment
   * ```conda create -n climate-data-analysis python=3.10```
   * conda activate climate-data-analysis

3. Install Required Packages

   * Run the following to install the dependencies: conda install numpy pandas matplotlib cartopy jupyter

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
   * jupyter notebook
