# Purpose of these scripts:
Perform basic analysis of climate data in various formats using Jupyter Notebook.

# Tutorial objectives:
* Access climate data in CSV (Comma Separated Values), Shapefile, and NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) formats.
* Calculate the mean, standard deviation, anomaly, and sum of the data.
* Compute linear regression trends, Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients, and significance tests with time series data.
* Visualize the data using scatterplots, line plots, and maps. 
* Identify areas where we could further utilize and/or develop tools within the group.
